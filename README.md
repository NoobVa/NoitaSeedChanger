# NoitaSeedChanger
This tool forces the game 'Noita' to use any seed you want.

Recent changes:

* Added release version recognition
* Removed all .ini related stuff
* Fixed some issues with the seed list

ToDo:

* Adding XML reader to be able to outsource release relevant data such as version hashes and memory targets

**Compatible with the latest beta Build (Nov 26 2019)**

Only supports **STEAM** releases currently. GoG or itch.io releases are not supported.
